# LDSC Replication: Brain MRI IDPs and Educational Attainment

Replication of genetic correlation analysis from Satizabal et al. (2019) using UK Biobank data.

## Results
- 163 IDPs analyzed
- Mean genetic correlation: rg = 0.041 (range: -0.11 to +0.19)
- 37 significant correlations (p<0.05, 22.7%)
- Top hit: Pars orbitalis (L) - rg=0.194, p=0.0001
