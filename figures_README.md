# Result Figures

## Figure 1: Scatterplot
Genetic correlations (rg) vs SNP-heritability (h²) for all 163 IDPs.
- Red: p < 0.01
- Orange: p < 0.05
- Gray: non-significant

## Figure 2: Distribution
Left: Histogram of rg values
Right: Violin plot comparing significant vs non-significant IDPs

## Figure 3: Top 20 IDPs
Barplot of the 20 most significant genetic correlations with EA.
